        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading1">Lamborghini</h4>
        <p>Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. (/ˌlæmbərˈɡiːni/ LAM-bər-GHEE-nee, Italian: [autoˈmɔːbili lamborˈɡiːni]),
            usually referred to as Lamborghini or colloquially Lambo, is an Italian manufacturer of luxury sports cars
            and SUVs based in Sant'Agata Bolognese. The company is owned by the Volkswagen Group through its subsidiary
            Audi.

            Ferruccio Lamborghini (1916–1993), an Italian manufacturing magnate, founded Automobili Ferruccio
            Lamborghini S.p.A. in 1963 to compete with Ferrari. The company was noted for using a rear mid-engine,
            rear-wheel drive layout. Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first decade, but sales plunged in the wake of
            the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. The firm's ownership changed three times after
            1973, including a bankruptcy in 1978. American Chrysler Corporation took control of Lamborghini in 1987 and
            sold it to Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994. In
            1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under the
            control of the group's Audi division.

            New products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio and brought to the market and saw an
            increased productivity for the brand. In the late 2000s, during the Great Recession, Lamborghini's sales
            dropped nearly 50%.

            Lamborghini currently produces twin-turbo V8 plug-in Hybrid Temerario, the Urus SUV powered by a twin-turbo
            V8 engine, and the Revuelto, a V12/electric hybrid, as of 2025. In addition, the company produces V12
            engines for offshore powerboat racing.

            Lamborghini Trattori, founded in 1948 by Ferruccio Lamborghini, is headquartered in Pieve di Cento, Italy,
            and continues to produce tractors. Since 1973, Lamborghini Trattori has been a separate entity from the
            Lamborghini's automobile division.

            History
            Main article: History of Lamborghini

            Ferruccio Lamborghini with a Jarama and a tractor of his brand
            Manufacturing magnate Italian Ferruccio Lamborghini founded the company in 1963 with the objective of
            producing a refined grand touring car to compete with offerings from established marques such as Ferrari.
            The company's first models, such as the 350 GT, were released in the mid-1960s. Lamborghini was noted for
            the 1966 Miura sports coupé, which used a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout.

            In 1963, Ferruccio Lamborghini, already an established industrialist who manufactured tractors, boilers, and
            air conditioners, founded Lamborghini Automobili on May 7, 1963.[5]

            The company was headquartered in a purpose-built facility in Sant'Agata Bolognese. He surrounded himself
            with highly capable engineers and technicians: Giotto Bizzarrini designed the engine, Gian Paolo Dallara and
            Paolo Stanzani developed the chassis, and Franco Scaglione designed the bodywork. The first model, the 350
            GTV, was not a success due to its futuristic style and remained a one-off prototype. The project was then
            handed over to the Milanese coachbuilder Touring, which created a more classic and sober design. The new
            car, named the 350 GT, was a fast and elegant two-seater grand tourer (according to Ferruccio's standards)
            and was the first series-produced car by Lamborghini. It achieved moderate sales success and was followed by
            the 400 GT (which benefited from an increased engine capacity) and the 400 GT 2+2, both presented in 1966.

            Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first ten years, but sales fell in the wake of the 1973 worldwide
            financial downturn and the oil crisis. Ferruccio Lamborghini sold the company to Georges-Henri Rossetti and
            René Leimer and retired in 1974. The company went bankrupt in 1978, and was placed in the receivership of
            brothers Jean-Claude and Patrick Mimran in 1980. The Mimrans purchased the company out of receivership by
            1984 and invested heavily in its expansion. Under the Mimrans' management, Lamborghini's model line was
            expanded from the Countach to include the Jalpa sports car and the LM002 high-performance off-road vehicle.

            The Mimrans sold Lamborghini to the Chrysler Corporation in 1987. After replacing the Countach with the
            Diablo and discontinuing the Jalpa and the LM002, Chrysler sold Lamborghini to Malaysian investment group
            Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold
            Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under the control of the group's Audi division. New
            products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio and brought to the market and saw an
            increased productivity for the brand Lamborghini. In the late 2000s, during the Great Recession,
            Lamborghini's sales dropped nearly 50%.</p>
        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading2">Ferrari</h4>
        <p>Ferrari S.p.A. (/fəˈrɑːri/; Italian: [ferˈraːri]) is an Italian luxury sports car manufacturer based in
            Maranello. Founded in 1939 by Enzo Ferrari (1898–1988), the company built its first car in 1940, adopted its
            current name in 1945, and began to produce its current line of road cars in 1947. Ferrari became a public
            company in 1960, and from 1963 to 2014 it was a subsidiary of Fiat S.p.A. It was spun off from Fiat's
            successor entity, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, in 2016. The company currently offers a large model range which
            includes several supercars, grand tourers, and one SUV. Many early Ferraris, dating to the 1950s and 1960s,
            count among the most expensive cars ever sold at auction.

            Throughout its history, the company has been noted for its continued participation in racing, especially in
            Formula One, where its team, Scuderia Ferrari, is the series' single oldest and most successful. Scuderia
            Ferrari has raced since 1929, first in Grand Prix events and later in Formula One, where it holds many
            records. Historically, Ferrari was also highly active in sports car racing, where its cars took many wins in
            races such as the Mille Miglia, Targa Florio and 24 Hours of Le Mans, as well as several overall victories
            in the World Sportscar Championship. Scuderia Ferrari fans, commonly called tifosi, are known for their
            passion and loyalty to the team.

            Ferrari is one of the world's strongest brands, and it maintains a brand image built around racing heritage,
            luxury, and exclusivity. As of May 2023, Ferrari is also one of the largest car manufacturers by market
            capitalisation, with a value of approximately US$85.5 billion.[7]

            History
            Main article: History of Ferrari
            Early history

            Three Scuderia Ferrari cars in 1934, all Alfa Romeo P3s. Drivers, left to right: Achille Varzi, Louis
            Chiron, and Carlo Felice Trossi.
            Enzo Ferrari, formerly a salesman and racing driver for Alfa Romeo, founded Scuderia Ferrari, a racing team,
            in 1929. Originally intended to service gentleman drivers and other amateur racers, Alfa Romeo's withdrawal
            from racing in 1933, combined with Enzo's connections within the company, turned Scuderia Ferrari into its
            unofficial representative on the track.[8] Alfa Romeo supplied racing cars to Ferrari, who eventually
            amassed some of the best drivers of the 1930s and won many races before the team's liquidation in
            1937.[8][9]: 43 

            Late in 1937, Scuderia Ferrari was liquidated and absorbed into Alfa Romeo,[8] but Enzo's disagreements with
            upper management caused him to leave in 1939. He used his settlement to found his own company, where he
            intended to produce his own cars. He called the company "Auto Avio Costruzioni", and headquartered it in the
            facilities of the old Scuderia Ferrari;[1] due to a noncompete agreement with Alfa Romeo, the company could
            not use the Ferrari name for another four years. The company produced a single car, the Auto Avio
            Costruzioni 815, which participated in only one race before the outbreak of World War II. During the war,
            Enzo's company produced aircraft engines and machine tools for the Italian military; the contracts for these
            goods were lucrative, and provided the new company with a great deal of capital. In 1943, under threat of
            Allied bombing raids, the company's factory was moved to Maranello. Though the new facility was nonetheless
            bombed twice, Ferrari remains in Maranello to this day.[1][9]: 45–47 [10]

            Under Enzo Ferrari

            Ferrari's factory in the early 1960s: everything in its production line was handmade by machinists, who
            followed technical drawings with extreme precision.[11] Much of this work is now done by industrial
            robots.[12]
            In 1945, Ferrari adopted its current name. Work started promptly on a new V12 engine that would power the
            125 S, which was the marque's first car, and many subsequent Ferraris. The company saw success in motorsport
            almost as soon as it began racing: the 125 S won many races in 1947,[13][14] and several early victories,
            including the 1949 24 Hours of Le Mans and 1951 Carrera Panamericana, helped build Ferrari's reputation as a
            high-quality automaker.[15][16] Ferrari won several more races in the coming years,[17][18] and early in the
            1950s its road cars were already a favourite of the international elite.[19] Ferrari produced many families
            of interrelated cars, including the America, Monza, and 250 series, and the company's first series-produced
            car was the 250 GT Coupé, beginning in 1958.[20]

            In 1960, Ferrari was reorganized as a public company. It soon began searching for a business partner to
            handle its manufacturing operations: it first approached Ford in 1963, though negotiations fell through;
            later talks with Fiat, who bought 50% of Ferrari's shares in 1969, were more successful.[21][22] In the
            second half of the decade, Ferrari also produced two cars that upended its more traditional models: the 1967
            Dino 206 GT, which was its first mass-produced mid-engined road car,[a] and the 1968 365 GTB/4, which
            possessed streamlined styling that modernised Ferrari's design language.[25][26] The Dino in particular was
            a decisive movement away from the company's conservative engineering approach, where every road-going
            Ferrari featured a V12 engine placed in the front of the car, and it presaged Ferrari's full embrace of
            mid-engine architecture, as well as V6 and V8 engines, in the 1970s and 1980s.[25]

            Contemporary
            Enzo Ferrari died in 1988, an event that saw Fiat expand its stake to 90%.[27] The last car that he
            personally approved—the F40—expanded on the flagship supercar approach first tried by the 288 GTO four years
            earlier.[28] Enzo was succeeded in 1991 by Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, under whose 23-year-long
            chairmanship the company greatly expanded. Between 1991 and 2014, he increased the profitability of
            Ferrari's road cars nearly tenfold, both by increasing the range of cars offered and through limiting the
            total number produced. Montezemolo's chairmanship also saw an expansion in licensing deals, a drastic
            improvement in Ferrari's Formula One performance (not least through the hiring of Michael Schumacher and
            Jean Todt), and the production of three more flagship cars: the F50, the Enzo, and the LaFerrari. In
            addition to his leadership of Ferrari, Montezemolo was also the chairman of Fiat proper between 2004 and
            2010.[29]

            After Montezemolo resigned, he was replaced in quick succession by many new chairmen and CEOs. He was
            succeeded first by Sergio Marchionne,[29] who would oversee Ferrari's initial public offering and subsequent
            spin-off from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles,[30][31] and then by Louis Camilleri as CEO and John Elkann as
            chairman.[32] Beginning in 2021, Camilleri was replaced as CEO by Benedetto Vigna, who has announced plans
            to develop Ferrari's first fully electric model.[33] During this period, Ferrari has expanded its
            production, owing to a global increase in wealth, while becoming more selective with its licensing
            deals.[34][35]</p>

            Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG, usually shortened to Porsche (German pronunciation: [ˈpɔʁʃə] ⓘ; see below), is
            a German automobile manufacturer specializing in luxury, high-performance sports cars, SUVs and sedans,
            headquartered in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The company is owned by Volkswagen AG, a controlling
            stake of which is owned by Porsche Automobil Holding SE, usually shortened to Porsche SE. Porsche's current
            lineup includes the 718, 911, Panamera, Macan, Cayenne and Taycan.

            The origins of the company date to the 1930s when German Bohemian automotive engineer Ferdinand Porsche
            founded Porsche[5] with Adolf Rosenberger, a keystone figure in the creation of German automotive
            manufacturer and Audi precursor Auto Union,[6] and Austrian businessman Anton Piëch, who was, at the time,
            also Ferdinand Porsche's son in law. In its early days, it was contracted by the German government to create
            a vehicle for the masses, which later became the Volkswagen Beetle.[7] After World War II, when Ferdinand, a
            member of both the Nazi Party and the SS, would be arrested for war crimes, his son Ferry Porsche, an SS
            volunteer, began building his own car, which would result in the Porsche 356.

            In 2009, Porsche entered an agreement with Volkswagen to create an 'integrated working group' by merging the
            two companies' car manufacturing operations.[8][9] By 2015, Porsche SE, the holding company spun off from
            the original Porsche firm, had a controlling interest in the Volkswagen Group, which included Audi and
            Lamborghini as subsidiaries.[10]

            History
            Origin
            Ferdinand Porsche (1875–1951) founded the company called "Dr. Ing. h. c. F. Porsche GmbH"[5] with Adolf
            Rosenberger[11] and Anton Piëch in 1931.[12] The name is short for Ferdinand Porsche's full title in German,
            Doktor-Ingenieur honoris causa (lit. 'Doctor of Engineering, Honorary Degree').[13] The main offices was at
            Kronenstraße 24 in the centre of Stuttgart.[14] Initially, the company offered motor vehicle development
            work and consulting,[5] but did not build any cars under its own name. One of the first assignments the new
            company received was from the German government to design a car for the people; that is, a Volkswagen.[5]
            This resulted in the Volkswagen Beetle, one of the most successful car designs of all time.[7] Later, the
            Porsche 64 would be developed in 1939 using many components from the Beetle.[5]


            Porsche's tank prototype, the "Porsche Tiger", that lost to Henschel & Son's Tiger I

            Panzerjäger Elefant – after the loss of the contract to the Tiger I, Porsche recycled his design into a tank
            destroyer.
            During World War II,[15] Volkswagen production turned to the military version of the Volkswagen Beetle, the
            Kübelwagen,[15] 52,000 produced, and Schwimmwagen,[15] 15,584 produced.[16] Porsche produced several designs
            for heavy tanks during the war, losing out to Henschel & Son in both contracts that ultimately led to the
            Tiger I and the Tiger II. However, not all this work was wasted, as the chassis Porsche designed for the
            Tiger I was used as the base for the Elefant tank destroyer. Porsche also developed the Maus super-heavy
            tank in the closing stages of the war, producing two prototypes.[17] Ferdinand Porsche's biographer, Fabian
            Müller, wrote that Porsche had thousands of people forcibly brought to work at their factories during the
            war. The workers wore the letter "P" on their clothing at all times. It stood not for "Porsche", but for
            "Poland".[18]

            At the end of World War II in 1945, the Volkswagen factory at KdF-Stadt fell to the British. Ferdinand lost
            his position as chairman of the board of management of Volkswagen, and Ivan Hirst, a British Army major, was
            put in charge of the factory.[a] On 15 December of that year, Ferdinand was arrested for war crimes, but not
            tried. During his 20-month imprisonment, Ferdinand Porsche's son, Ferry Porsche, decided to build his own
            car, because he could not find an existing one that he wanted to buy. He also had to steer the company
            through some of its most difficult days until his father's release in August 1947.[20]

            The first models of what was to become the 356 were built in a small sawmill in Gmünd, Austria.[20] The
            prototype car was shown to German auto dealers, and when pre-orders reached a set threshold, production
            (with aluminum body) was begun by Porsche Konstruktionen GesmbH, founded by Ferry and Louise. Many regard
            the 356 as the first Porsche simply because it was the first model sold by the fledgling company. After
            production of the 356 was taken over by the father's Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche GmbH in Stuttgart in 1950,
            Porsche commissioned a Zuffenhausen-based company, Reutter Karosserie, which had previously collaborated
            with the firm on Volkswagen Beetle prototypes, to produce the 356's steel body. In 1952, Porsche constructed
            an assembly plant (Werk 2) across the street from Reutter Karosserie; the main road in front of Werk 1, the
            oldest Porsche building, is now known as Porschestraße.[21] The 356 was road-certified in 1948.

            Coat of arms of Württemberg during the Weimar-era

            Coat of arms of Stuttgart
            Coat of arms of Stuttgart
            Porsche's company logo stems from the coat of arms of the Free People's State of Württemberg of Weimar
            Germany of 1918–1933, which had Stuttgart as its capital. (The Bundesland of Württemberg-Hohenzollern used
            the same arms from 1945 to 1952, while Stuttgart during these years operated as the capital of adjacent
            Württemberg-Baden.) The arms of Stuttgart appear in the middle of the logo as an inescutcheon, for the
            company had its headquarters in Stuttgart. The heraldic symbols, combined with the texts "Porsche" and
            "Stuttgart", do not form a conventional coat of arms, since heraldic achievements never spell out the name
            of the armiger nor the armiger's home town in the shield.

            Württemberg-Baden and Württemberg-Hohenzollern both in 1952 became part of the present Bundesland of
            Baden-Württemberg after the political consolidation of West Germany in 1949, but the old design of the arms
            of Württemberg lives on in the Porsche logo. On 30 January 1951, not long before the formation of
            Baden-Württemberg, Ferdinand Porsche died from complications following a stroke.

            Developments

            1952 Porsche 356 K/9-1 prototype
            In post-war Germany, parts were generally in short supply, so the 356 automobile used components from the
            Volkswagen Beetle, including the engine case from its internal combustion engine, transmission, and several
            parts used in the suspension. The 356, however, had several evolutionary stages, A, B, and C, while in
            production, and most Volkswagen-sourced parts were replaced by Porsche-made parts. Beginning in 1954 the
            356s engines started utilizing engine cases designed specifically for the 356. The sleek bodywork was
            designed by Erwin Komenda, who also had designed the body of the Beetle. Porsche's signature designs have,
            from the beginning, featured air-cooled rear-engine configurations (like the Beetle), rare for other car
            manufacturers, but producing automobiles that are very well balanced.

            In 1964, after a fair amount of success in motor-racing with various models including the 550 Spyder, and
            with the 356 needing a major re-design, the company launched the Porsche 911: another air-cooled,
            rear-engined sports car, this time with a six-cylinder "boxer" engine. The team to lay out the body shell
            design was led by Ferry Porsche's eldest son, Ferdinand Alexander Porsche (F. A.). The design phase for the
            911 caused internal problems with Erwin Komenda, who led the body design department until then. F. A.
            Porsche complained Komenda made unauthorized changes to the design. Company leader Ferry Porsche took his
            son's drawings to neighbouring chassis manufacturer Reuter. Reuter's workshop was later acquired by Porsche
            (so-called Werk 2). Afterward, Reuter became a seat manufacturer, today known as Keiper-Recaro.


            The Porsche 912, from the 1960s
            The design office gave sequential numbers to every project (See Porsche type numbers), but the designated
            901 nomenclature contravened Peugeot's trademarks on all 'x0x' names, so it was adjusted to 911. Racing
            models adhered to the "correct" numbering sequence: 904, 906, 908. The 911 has become Porsche's most
            well-known model – successful on the race-track, in rallies, and in terms of road car sales. It remains in
            production; however, after several generations of revision, current-model 911s share only the basic
            mechanical configuration of a rear-engined, six-cylinder coupé, and basic styling cues with the original
            car. A cost-reduced model with the same body, but with a 356-derived four-cylinder engine, was sold as the
            912.

            In 1972, the company's legal form was changed from Kommanditgesellschaft (KG), or limited partnership, to
            Aktiengesellschaft (AG), or public limited company, because Ferry Porsche came to believe the scale of the
            company outgrew a "family operation", after learning about Soichiro Honda's "no family members in the
            company" policy at Honda. This led to the establishment of an executive board with members from outside the
            Porsche family, and a supervisory board consisting largely of family members. With this change, most family
            members in the operation of the company, including F. A. Porsche and Ferdinand Piëch, departed from the
            company.

            F. A. Porsche founded his own design company, Porsche Design, which is renowned for exclusive sunglasses,
            watches, furniture, and many other luxury articles. Louise's son and Ferry's nephew Ferdinand Piëch, who was
            responsible for mechanical development of Porsche's production and racing cars (including the very
            successful 911, 908 and 917 models), formed his own engineering bureau, and developed a five-cylinder-inline
            diesel engine for Mercedes-Benz. A short time later he moved to Audi (used to be a division, then a
            subsidiary, of Volkswagen), and pursued his career through the entire company, ultimately becoming the
            chairman of Volkswagen Group.

            The first chief executive officer (CEO) of Porsche AG was Ernst Fuhrmann, who had been working in the
            company's engine development division. Fuhrmann was responsible for the so-called Fuhrmann-engine, used in
            the 356 Carrera models as well as the 550 Spyder, having four overhead camshafts instead of a central
            camshaft with pushrods, as in the Volkswagen-derived serial engines. He planned to cease the 911 during the
            1970s and replace it with the V8-front engined grand sportswagon 928. As we know today, the 911 outlived the
            928 by far. Fuhrmann was replaced in the early 1980s by Peter W. Schutz, an American manager and
            self-proclaimed 911 aficionado. He was then replaced in 1988 by the former manager of German computer
            company Nixdorf Computer AG, Arno Bohn, who made some costly miscalculations that led to his dismissal soon
            after, along with that of the development director, Ulrich Bez, who was formerly responsible for BMW's Z1
            model, and was CEO of Aston Martin from 2000 to 2013.[22]


            Porsche 911 (964), introduced in 1989, was the first to be offered with Porsche's Tiptronic transmission and
            four-wheel drive.
            In 1990, Porsche drew up a memorandum of understanding with Toyota to learn and benefit from Japanese lean
            manufacturing methods. In 2004 it was reported that Toyota was assisting Porsche with hybrid technology.[23]

            Following the dismissal of Bohn, Heinz Branitzki, a longtime Porsche employee, was appointed as interim CEO.
            Branitzki served in that position until Wendelin Wiedeking became CEO in 1993. Wiedeking took over the
            chairmanship of the board at a time when Porsche appeared vulnerable to a takeover by a larger company.
            During his long tenure, Wiedeking transformed Porsche into a very efficient and profitable company.

            Ferdinand Porsche's nephew, Ferdinand Piëch, was chairman and CEO of the Volkswagen Group from 1993 to 2002
            and is chairman of the Volkswagen AG Supervisory Board since then. With 12.8 percent of the Porsche SE
            voting shares, he also remains the second-largest individual shareholder of Porsche SE after his cousin, F.
            A. Porsche, which had 13.6 percent.

            Porsche's 2002 introduction of the Cayenne also marked the unveiling of a new production facility in
            Leipzig, Saxony, which once accounted for nearly half of Porsche's annual output. In 2004, production of the
            456 kilowatts (620 PS; 612 bhp) Carrera GT commenced in Leipzig, and at EUR 450,000 ($440,000 in the United
            States) it was the most expensive production model Porsche ever built.


            Porsche 911 (991)
            In mid-2006, after years of the Boxster (and later the Cayenne) as the best selling Porsche in North
            America, the 911 regained its position as Porsche's best-seller in the region. The Cayenne and 911 have
            cycled as the top-selling model since. In Germany, the 911 outsells the Boxster/Cayman and Cayenne.[24]

            In May 2011, Porsche Cars North America announced plans to spend $80–$100 million, but will receive about
            $15 million in economic incentives to move their North American headquarters from Sandy Springs, a suburb of
            Atlanta, to Aerotropolis Atlanta, a new mixed-use development on the site of the old Ford Hapeville plant
            adjacent to Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport.[25] Designed by architectural firm HOK, the
            headquarters will include a new office building and test track.[26][27][28] The facility will be known by
            its new address, One Porsche Drive.

            In October 2017, Porsche Cars North America announced the launch of Porsche Passport,[29] a new sports car
            and SUV subscription program. This new offering allows consumers to access Porsche vehicles through
            subscribing to the service, rather than owning or leasing a vehicle. The Porsche Passport service was
            available initially in Atlanta,[30][31] and has become available in many major cities across the US.[32]

            During the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, Porsche suspended its manufacturing in Europe for two weeks,
            "By taking this step, the sports car manufacturer is responding to the significant acceleration in the rate
            of infection caused by the coronavirus and the resultant measures implemented by the relevant
            authorities."[33]

            In August 2022, Bloomberg News reported that Porsche has lined up interest in subscription of its initial
            public offering for a valuation between US$60–85 billion. It is expected to be listed on Frankfurt Stock
            Exchange in September.[34]

            Relationship with Volkswagen

            Combined badging of the European 914
            The company has always had a close relationship with, initially, the Volkswagen (VW) marque, and later, the
            Volkswagen Group (which also owns Audi AG), because the first Volkswagen Beetle was designed by Ferdinand
            Porsche.

            The two companies collaborated in 1969 to make the VW-Porsche 914 and 914-6, whereby the 914-6 had a Porsche
            engine, and the 914 had a Volkswagen engine. Further collaboration in 1976 resulted in the Porsche 912E (US
            only) and the Porsche 924, which used many Audi components, and was built at Audi's Neckarsulm factory,
            which had been NSU's. Porsche 944s were also built there,[35] although they used far fewer Volkswagen
            components. The Cayenne, introduced in 2002, shares its chassis with the Volkswagen Touareg and the Audi Q7,
            which is built at the Volkswagen Group factory in Bratislava, Slovakia.

            Porsche SE was created in June 2007 by renaming the old Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG, and became a holding
            company for the families' stake in Porsche Zwischenholding GmbH (50.1%) (which in turn held 100% of the old
            Porsche AG) and Volkswagen AG (50.7%).[36][9] At the same time, the new Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG (Porsche
            AG) was created for the car manufacturing business.

            In August 2009, Porsche SE and Volkswagen AG reached an agreement that the car manufacturing operations of
            the two companies would merge in 2011, to form an "Integrated Automotive Group".[8][37] The management of
            Volkswagen AG agreed to 50.76% of Volkswagen AG being owned by Porsche SE in return for Volkswagen AG
            management taking Porsche SE management positions (in order for Volkswagen management to remain in control),
            and for Volkswagen AG acquiring ownership of Porsche AG.

            As of the end of 2015, the 52.2% control interest in Volkswagen AG is the predominant investment by Porsche
            SE, and VW AG in turn controls brands and companies such as Volkswagen, Audi, SEAT, Škoda, Bentley, Bugatti,
            Lamborghini, Porsche AG, Ducati, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, Scania, MAN, as well as Volkswagen
            Financial Services.[10]

            Porsche AG, as a 100% subsidiary of VW AG, is responsible for the actual production and manufacture of the
            Porsche automobile line. The company currently produces Porsche 911,[38] Boxster and Cayman sports cars, the
            Cayenne and Macan sport utility vehicles and the four-door Panamera.

            In addition to its subsidiaries Porsche Design and Porsche Engineering, Porsche AG owns the consulting firm
            MHP Management- und IT-Beratung, which was fully acquired by January 2024.[39] Porsche also has a 29% share
            in German engineering and design consultancy Bertrandt AG.[40][41] In 2018, Porsche acquired a 10% minority
            shareholding stake of the Croatian electric sportscar manufacturer Rimac Automobili to form a development
            partnership.[42][43]

            Initial public offering
            In February 2022, Volkswagen AG had announced that it would examine the feasibility of a possible IPO of
            Porsche AG.[44] The share capital of Porsche AG has been divided into 50% non-voting preference shares and
            50% ordinary shares.[44][4] Volkswagen AG will retain 75% of ordinary shares, while Porsche SE will acquire
            25% of ordinary shares. Volkswagen AG will also retain 75% of preference shares, while 25% of preference
            shares (12.5% of share capital) will be sold during IPO,[44] while Qatar Investment Authority has already
            committed to buy 4.99% of preference shares, leaving another 20.01% (10% of share capital), to other
            investors.[4] As part of the preliminary offering, 113,875 thousand shares were sold at the upper limit of
            the price range - 82.5 euros. Thus, the value of the company was estimated at 75 billion euros. In the first
            hours of trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on 29 September, the share price rose to 84 euros.[45]

            In April 2022, Porsche Australia announced they are planning to open an efuel manufacturing facility in the
            island state of Tasmania. The plant will be the first of its type in the country. The facility is to be
            named the HIF (Highly Innovative Fuels) Tasmania Carbon Neutral eFuel Plant. It is slated to open in
            2026.[46]</p>
        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading4">BMW</h4>
        <p>Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft,[3] trading as BMW Group (commonly abbreviated to BMW (German
            pronunciation: [ˌbeːʔɛmˈveː] ⓘ), sometimes anglicised as Bavarian Motor Works), is a German multinational
            manufacturer of luxury vehicles and motorcycles headquartered in Munich, Bavaria, Germany. The company was
            founded in 1916 as a manufacturer of aircraft engines, which it produced from 1917 to 1918 and again from
            1933 to 1945, creating engines for aircraft that were used in the Second World War.

            The company's automobiles are marketed under the BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce brands, and motorcycles are
            marketed under the BMW Motorrad brand. In 2023, BMW was the world's ninth-largest producer of motor
            vehicles, and the 6th largest by revenue,[4] with 2,555,341 vehicles produced in that year alone.[5] In
            2023, the company was ranked 46th in the Forbes Global 2000.[6] The company has significant motor-sport
            history, especially in touring cars, sports cars, and the Isle of Man TT.

            BMW is headquartered in Munich and produces motor vehicles in Germany, the United Kingdom, the United
            States, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, India, China, and previously also in the Netherlands (ceased in
            2023).[7] The Quandt family [de] is a long-term shareholder of the company, following investments by the
            brothers Herbert and Harald Quandt in 1959, saved BMW from bankruptcy, with remaining shares owned by the
            public.

            History
            Main article: History of BMW
            The Otto Flugmaschinenfabrik was founded in 1910 by Gustav Otto in the Kingdom of Bavaria, which was a state
            of the German Empire. The firm was reorganized on 7 March 1916 into Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG. This
            company was then renamed to Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW) in 1922. However, the name BMW dates back to
            1913, when a company using that name was founded by Karl Rapp initially as Rapp Motorenwerke. The name and
            Rapp Motorenwerke's engine-production assets were transferred to Bayerische Flugzeugwerke in 1922, who
            adopted the name the same year.[8] BMW's first product was an engine for fighter aircraft of the
            Luftstreitkräfte. It was a straight-six called the BMW IIIa, designed in the spring of 1917 by engineer Max
            Friz. Following the end of World War I, BMW remained in business by producing motorcycle engines,
            agricultural equipment, household items, and railway brakes. The company produced its first motorcycle, the
            BMW R 32, in 1923.

            BMW became an automobile manufacturer in 1928 when it purchased Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach, which, at the time,
            built the Austin 7 under licence from Automobilwerk Eisenach, badged as the Dixi.[9] The first car sold as a
            BMW was a rebadged Dixi called the BMW 3/15, following BMW's acquisition of the car manufacturer
            Automobilwerk Eisenach. Throughout the 1930s, BMW expanded its range into sports cars and larger luxury
            cars.[10][11]

            Aircraft engines, motorcycles, and automobiles would be BMW's main products until World War II. During the
            war, BMW concentrated on building the BMW 801 aircraft engine using as many as 40,000 slave laborers.[12]
            These consisted primarily of prisoners from Nazi concentration camps, most prominently Dachau. Motorcycles
            remained as a side-line and automobile manufacture ceased altogether.

            BMW's factories were heavily bombed during the war and its remaining West German facilities were banned from
            producing motor vehicles or aircraft after the war. The company survived by making pots, pans, and bicycles.
            In 1948, BMW restarted motorcycle production. BMW resumed car production in Bavaria in 1952 with the BMW 501
            luxury saloon. The range of cars was expanded in 1955, through the production of the cheaper Isetta microcar
            under licence. Slow sales of luxury cars and small profit margins from microcars, meant BMW was in serious
            financial trouble and in 1959 the company was nearly taken over by rival Daimler-Benz.[13][14]

            A large investment in BMW by Herbert Quandt and Harald Quandt resulted in the company surviving as a
            separate entity. Günther Quandt was a well-known German industrialist and joined the Nazi party in 1933; he
            made a fortune arming the German Wehrmacht, manufacturing weapons and batteries.[15] Many of his enterprises
            were appropriated from Jewish owners under duress with minimal compensation. At least three of his
            enterprises made extensive use of slave laborers, as many as 50,000 in all.[16] One of his battery factories
            had its own on-site concentration camp, complete with gallows. Life expectancy for laborers was six
            months.[16][17] While Quandt and BMW were not directly connected during the war, funds amassed in the Nazi
            era by his father allowed Herbert Quandt to buy BMW.[12]

            The relative success of the small BMW 700 assisted in the company's recovery, allowing them to develop the
            New Class sedans.


            1972 BMW 5 Series (1st generation)
            The 1962 introduction of the BMW New Class compact sedans was the beginning of BMW's reputation as a leading
            manufacturer of sport-oriented cars. Throughout the 1960s, BMW expanded its range by adding coupé and luxury
            sedan models. The BMW 5 Series mid-size sedan range was introduced in 1972, followed by the BMW 3 Series
            compact sedans in 1975, the BMW 6 Series luxury coupés in 1976 and the BMW 7 Series large luxury sedans in
            1978.

            The BMW M division released its first road car, the M1, a mid-engine supercar, in 1978. This was followed by
            the BMW M5 in 1984 and the BMW M3 in 1986. Also in 1986, BMW introduced its first V12 engine in the 750i
            luxury sedan. The 1989 BMW Z1 marked BMW's return to making a two-seat roadster, the 1995 BMW Z3 was their
            first mass-production two-seat roadster, and the 1999 BMW X5 was the company's first entry into the SUV
            market.

            The company purchased the Rover Group in 1994, but the takeover was not successful and caused BMW large
            financial losses. In 2000, BMW sold off most of the Rover brands, retaining only the Mini brand. In 1998,
            BMW also acquired the rights to the Rolls-Royce brand from Vickers.

            The first modern mass-produced turbocharged petrol engine was introduced in 2006 (from 1973 to 1975, BMW
            built 1,672 units of a turbocharged BMW M10 engine for the BMW 02 Series),[18] with most engines switching
            over to turbocharging over the 2010s. The first hybrid BMW was the 2010 BMW ActiveHybrid 7, and BMW's first
            mass-production electric car was the BMW i3 city car, which was released in 2013, (from 1968 to 1972, BMW
            built two battery-electric BMW 1602 Elektro saloons for the 1972 Olympic Games).[19] After many years of
            establishing a reputation for sporting rear-wheel drive cars, BMW's first front-wheel drive car was the 2014
            BMW 2 Series Active Tourer multi-purpose vehicle (MPV).

            In March 2018, Daimler and BMW merged their mobility services.[20]

            In August 2019, Oliver Zipse replaced Harald Krüger as the head of the BMW Group.[21]

            21st century
            In January 2021, BMW announced that its sales in 2020 fell by 8.4 percent due to the impact of COVID-19
            pandemic restrictions. However, in the fourth quarter of 2020, BMW witnessed a rise of 3.2% in its
            customers' demands.[22] This recovery was supported by the company's adoption of widely accepted
            technologies and integration of third-party services such as Apple Pay and on-demand music as well as key
            partnerships such as its collaboration with Daimler on autonomous driving.[23][24] Additionally, BMW's
            strategic investment decisions which include localizing production of its SUVs to the Spartanburg plant in
            the U.S., placed the group in a position to easily navigate trade challenges and shifting consumer
            patterns.[23]

            On 18 January 2022 BMW announced a BMW 7 Series (G11) special edition simply called "The Final V12",[25] the
            last BMW series production vehicle to be fitted with a V-12 engine.[25]

            On 5 October 2023 it was announced that BMW UK CEO Chris Brownridge would succeed Torsten Müller-Ötvös as
            the CEO of Rolls-Royce starting 1 December 2023, as a result of Müller-Ötvös retiring.[26]

            Branding

            BMW badge on a 1931 Dixi

            Flag of Bavaria

            1970 BMW 2002ti Garmisch concept
            Company name
            BMW is an abbreviation for Bayerische Motoren Werke. This name is grammatically incorrect (in German,
            compound words must not contain spaces), which is why the grammatically correct form of the name, Bayerische
            Motorenwerke (German pronunciation: [ˈbaɪʁɪʃə moˈtoːʁənˌvɛʁkə] ⓘ) has been used in several publications and
            advertisements in the past.[27][28] Bayerische Motorenwerke translates into English as Bavarian Motor
            Works.[29] The suffix AG, short for Aktiengesellschaft, signifies an incorporated entity owned by
            shareholders, thus akin to "Inc." (US) or PLC, "Public Limited Company" (UK).

            The terms Beemer, Bimmer and Bee-em are sometimes used as slang for BMW in the English language[30][31] and
            are sometimes used interchangeably for cars and motorcycles.[32][33][34]

            Logo
            The circular blue and white BMW logo or roundel evolved from the circular Rapp Motorenwerke company logo,
            which featured a black ring bearing the company name surrounding the company logo,[35] an image of a horse
            head on a plinth. BMW retained Rapp's black ring inscribed with the company name, but the interior of the
            ring is quartered blue and white, reminiscent of the coat of arms and flag of Bavaria (which in turn are
            based on the arms of the historic House of Wittelsbach, which ruled Bavaria for many centuries).[35] The
            logo does not bear the distinctive lozenge shape found on the coat of arms, however, as local laws at the
            time it was introduced forbade the use of state coats of arms on commercial logos.[36]

            A persistent myth claims that the logo is based on the image of an airplane propeller spinning in a blue
            sky. This myth likely stems from a 1929 BMW advertisement that depicted the logo superimposed on a rotating
            propeller. However, the logo predates that advertisement by 12 years.[35][37]

            The current iteration of the logo was introduced in 2020,[38] removing 3D effects that had been used in
            previous renderings of the logo while removing the black outline encircling the rondel. The logo is used for
            BMW's branding communications but it is not used on vehicles.[39][40]</p>
        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading5">RollsRoyelse</h4>
        <p>Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited is a British luxury automobile maker that has operated as a wholly owned
            subsidiary of BMW AG since 2003 – as the exclusive manufacturer of Rolls-Royce-branded motor cars. The
            company's administrative and production headquarters are located on the 42-acre (17 ha) Goodwood Estate in
            Goodwood, West Sussex, England, United Kingdom.[3]

            From 1906 to 2003, motor cars were manufactured and marketed under the Rolls-Royce brand by Rolls-Royce
            Limited and Rolls-Royce Motors. The Rolls-Royce Motor Cars subsidiary of BMW AG has no direct relationship
            to Rolls-Royce-branded vehicles produced before 2003, other than having briefly supplied components and
            engines. The Bentley Motors Limited subsidiary of Volkswagen AG is the direct successor to Rolls-Royce
            Motors and various other predecessor entities that produced Rolls-Royce and Bentley branded cars between the
            foundation of each company and 2003, when the BMW-controlled entity started producing cars under the
            Rolls-Royce brand.

            The BBC called Rolls-Royce "probably one of the most recognised icons in the world", and that "the name
            Rolls-Royce entered the English language as a superlative."[4]

            The company's line of vehicles includes the Phantom, the top-of-the-line four-door saloon first offered in
            2003 - as of January 2025, it is offered in two lengths; the smaller Ghost four-door saloon - also offered
            in two lengths; the Cullinan SUV, and the Spectre coupé. The last being Rolls-Royce's first electric car.[5]

            History

            Spirit of Ecstasy, the bonnet mascot sculpture on Rolls-Royce cars
            Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited was created as a wholly owned subsidiary of BMW in 1998 after BMW licensed
            the rights to the Rolls-Royce brand name and logo from Rolls-Royce Holdings plc,[6] and acquired the rights
            to the Spirit of Ecstasy and Rolls-Royce grille shape trademarks from Volkswagen AG. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars
            Limited has been manufacturing Rolls-Royce branded cars since 2003.

            Although the Rolls-Royce brand has been in use since 1906, the fate of the brand diverged between 1998 and
            2003. In 2003, the Rolls-Royce Motor Cars subsidiary of BMW AG, which had been a major supplier to the brand
            up to 2003, began manufacturing vehicles with the Rolls-Royce name. Volkswagen AG took ownership of the
            Bentley name as well as previous Rolls-Royce production facilities and previous Rolls-Royce designs.

            Former chief executive Torsten Müller-Ötvös joined the company in January 2010, with a pledge to regain the
            quality standards that made Rolls-Royce famous. That year sales in China increased by 600%, making it the
            company's second largest market after the US.[7]

            On October 5, 2023, Rolls-Royce announced that Müller-Ötvös will be retiring as CEO on November 30 after 14
            years. He is succeeded by Chris Brownridge, the former CEO of BMW UK, who became the company's new CEO on
            December 1, 2023.[8][9] Müller-Ötvös was the company's longest serving CEO to date.

            Ownership and licensing of trademarks

            Rolls-Royce Motor Cars emblem
            In 1998, Vickers decided to sell Rolls-Royce Motors. The most likely buyer was BMW, which already supplied
            engines and other components for Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars, but BMW's final offer of £340 million was
            beaten by Volkswagen's £430 million ($703 million).[10]

            A stipulation in the ownership documents of Rolls-Royce dictated that Rolls-Royce Holdings plc, the
            aero-engine maker, would retain certain essential trademarks, including the Rolls-Royce brand name and logo
            if the automotive division was sold. Although Vickers plc sold the vehicle designs, nameplates,
            administrative headquarters, production facilities, Spirit of Ecstasy and Rolls-Royce grille shape
            trademarks to Volkswagen AG, Rolls-Royce plc chose to license the Rolls-Royce name and logo to BMW AG for
            £40 million ($66 million), because Rolls-Royce plc had recently had joint business ventures with BMW.[11]

            BMW's contract to supply engines and components to Rolls-Royce Motors allowed BMW to cancel the contract
            with 12 months' notice. Volkswagen would be unable to re-engineer the Rolls-Royce and Bentley vehicles to
            use other engines within that time frame. With the Rolls-Royce brand identification marks split between the
            two companies and Volkswagen's engine supply in jeopardy, the two companies entered into negotiations.
            Volkswagen agreed to sell BMW the Spirit of Ecstasy and grille shape trademarks and BMW agreed to continue
            supplying engines and components until 2003. Volkswagen continued to produce Rolls-Royce branded vehicles
            between 1998 and 2003. This gave BMW time to build a new Rolls-Royce administrative headquarters and
            production facility on the Goodwood Estate near Chichester, West Sussex, and develop the Phantom, the first
            Rolls-Royce from the new company. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited became the exclusive manufacturer of
            Rolls-Royce branded cars in 2003. Rolls-Royce announced in September 2014 that a new technology and
            logistics centre would be built, which opened in 2016, 8 miles away from the main headquarters, in the
            seaside resort town of Bognor Regis.[12][13]
